That’s why in simulations sometimes our model is called “population model”, and from our data generating model we produce observed data.\n\nRemember when we talked about random variables vs. fixed quantities?\n\nWhen we refer to the DATA (population model) the variables are random, but when we generate data like we did in R that data are fixed quantities similar to collect data on campus related to dating strategies, once you collect your data, those numbers are fixed quantities that were generate by a natural process (data generating process). We cannot control the natural process like we do in simulation.\n\nWe reduce uncertainty when we add more observations. We will study more about it in the next classes."

    "text": "What is a p-value?\n\np-value stands for probability value.\nIt was born as a measure to reject a hypothesis.\nIn statistics and science, we always have hypothesis in mind. Statistics translates our hypothesis into evaluations of our hypothesis.\nFor example, we often ask questions to our selves such as: why my boyfriend won’t express her feelings? and then we ask, is this related to gender? Is it true that women share easily their emotions compare to men? If so, does it happen only to me? Is this a coincidence?\nWe can create a hypothesis with these questions, let’s try to write one:\n\n\\(H_{1}\\) = There is a difference in emotional expression between cisgender women and cisgender men.\n\nThis is our alternaive hypothesis but we need a null hypothesis:\n\n\\(H_{0}\\) = There is no difference in emotional expression between cisgender women and cisgender men.\n\nThat was easy you might think, but why do we need a null statement?\n\nScience always starts with a null believe, and what we do as scientist is to collect evidence that might help to reject the null hypothesis. If you collect data to support your alternative hypothesis you would be doing something called “confirmation bias”.\nConfirmation bias consist of collecting information that only supports your alternative hypothesis.\nFor example, you start collecting data that only proofs that all swans are white, instead of looking at information that helps to reject the null: not all swans are white."

But in reality the \\(t\\)-test should reject the null hypothesis 100% of the times.\nLet’s check when we assume equal variances in our \\(t\\) - test and the model that generates is actually a process with equal variances:\n\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(1234)\n\nN1 <- 50\n\nN2 <- 50\n\nMean1 <- 100\n\nMean2 <- 20\n\nresults_2 <- list()\n\nfor(i in 1:10000){\n  \ngroup1 <- rnorm(N1, mean = Mean1, sd = 5) ## equal variances or standard deviation\n\ngroup2 <-  rnorm(N2, mean = Mean2, sd = 5) ## equal variances or standard deviation\n\ndataSim <- data.frame(genValues = c(group1,group2), \n                      groupVar = c(rep(1,N1),rep(0,N2)))\n\nresults_2[[i]] <- t.test(genValues ~ groupVar, data = dataSim, var.equal = TRUE)$p.value\n}\n\n### Probability of rejecting the null hypothesis\n\ncat(\"Proportion of times we rejected the null hypothesis\", sum(unlist(results_2) <= .05)/length(results_2)*100)\n\n\nProportion of times we rejected the null hypothesis 100\n\n\n\nThis time we are rejecting the null hypothesis 100% of the times. This is what we were looking for! Remember that we generated data from a process where group 1 had a mean of 100, and the group 2 had a mean of 20. The t-test should reject the null hypothesis every time I generate new data sets, but this doesn’t happen when I made the wrong assumption: I assumed equal variances when I should not do it.\nSummary: when we wrongly assume that the variances are equal between groups, we decrease the probability to reject the null hypothesis when the null should be rejected. This is bad!\nThese simulations showed the relevance of respecting the assumptions of the \\(t\\)-test."

Prediction is more like a “what-if” analysis. It is a prediction about the future but also , you can answer what might have happened in the past.\nA regression model can be represented as:\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nY|X = x \\sim p(y|x)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nThis means the expression \\(p(y|X=x)\\) is the distribution of potentially observable \\(Y\\) values when \\(X = x\\), and is called the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\), given that \\(X = x\\).\nIn simple words, in regression we are estimating a conditional distribution.

Understanding Nature requires common observation—that is, it encompasses those things that we can agree we are observing” (p.1)\nAs psychologist we study behavior, thoughts, emotions, beliefs, cognition and contextual aspects of all the above. These elements are also part of nature, we mainly study constructs, I will talk about constructs frequently.\nStatistics is the language of science. Statistics concerns the analysis of recorded information or data. Data are commonly observed and subject to common agreement and are therefore more likely to reflect our common reality or Nature."

We can transform age to get a meaningful zero.\nThere is something call \\(z\\)-values, others call it \\(z\\)-scores. This tranformation is based on the normal distribution.\nLet’s see the formula to transform any continuous distribution into \\(z\\) values:\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nz= \\frac{x_{i}-\\bar{x}}{\\sigma}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere: - \\(x_{i}\\) is each observed value. - \\(\\bar{x}\\) is the mean of the observed values. - \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the observed values.\n\nAs you can see, what we do is to tranform the distribution, now the observed values will be centered at zero. It means the mean is going to be zero, and the values will be negative and positive values.\nIn R you can transform any continiuos distributin into \\(z\\)-values using the function scale().\n\n\nWage$age_Z <- scale(Wage$age)\nsummary(Wage[, c(\"age\", \"age_Z\")])\n\n      age             age_Z.V1      \n Min.   :18.00   Min.   :-2.115215  \n 1st Qu.:33.75   1st Qu.:-0.750681  \n Median :42.00   Median :-0.035925  \n Mean   :42.41   Mean   : 0.000000  \n 3rd Qu.:51.00   3rd Qu.: 0.743808  \n Max.   :80.00   Max.   : 3.256282  \n\n\n\nIn the example above, you can see that the mean of age is now zero after transforming the distribution. Also, notice that age_Z ranges from -2.12 to 3.26.\nGiven that now we have \\(z\\)-values we can interpret the values in terms of standard deviations from the mean. For instance, we can say that 18 years old is a value located -2.12 standard deviation below the mean (because the value is negative), we can also say that 80 years old is a value located 3.26 standard deviations above the mean (because the value is positive)"

    "text": "Four principles of adult development\n\nChanges Are Continuous Over the Life Span: Changing is a cumulative process, all the changes you experienced in the adolescence will affect your changes in adulthood. In science, we separate the human’s life span into stages to make easier to study all the changes, but we need to see the context of those changes as a continuum interconnected.\nOnly the Survivors Grow Old: The survivor principle states that the people who live to old age are the ones who managed to outlive the many threats that could have caused their deaths at earlier ages. In human development, we aim to study how people survive, we also aim to describe the characteristic of the healthy survivor. Some survivors are individuals with better physical and cognitive skills, they might have also made changes in their lifestyle to live longer. But, there are a portion of individuals who never change their habits and still they live longer. Why do you think this happens?\nIndividuality matter: As Whitbourne & Whitbourne (2020) mentioned in their book, people who are not scientist, assume that all older adults are “similar”. This is a big misconception, as we grow older, we change a lot. Our life path starts becoming very different as we grow compare to our peers. You might find a lot of similar characteristics in teenagers, but aging adults will have a larger “baggage” where life events changed their development in different ways. This is always a challenge when you try to describe and predict changes in aging adults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant concepts\n\n\nInterindividual differences: differences between people.\nIntraindividual differences: differences within the same individual.\n\n\n\n\n“Normal” Aging Is Different From Disease: The principle that normal aging is different from disease means that growing older doesn’t necessarily mean growing sicker."

But, in many countries in the world 18 years of age is the threshold. In fact, are there real differences between a person who is 18 years old compare to a 21 years old person? What marks the difference?\nLegally, and culturally, the age of consent, voting or driving a car defines this rule in several countries."

According to Baltes, there are normative age-graded influences that shape our life.\nFor example, there a cultural norms that say when we should get married, when should we get our degrees, and when should we have children. If a person doesn’t follow these norms, upsetting feelings emerge as a consequence of not meeting the social expectations.\nThere are normative history-graded influences, these are events that happened to everyone or a cohort of individuals. Wars or economic trends are a good example. The best most recent example is the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of a historical influence in our development. These events will change the culture, politics, and your health if you got the virus.\nNonnormative influcences are random idiosyncratic events that occur to an individual, they might occur with no regular pattern.

    "section": "Relevant questions related to NATURE",
    "text": "Relevant questions related to NATURE\nPlease answer the following questions, if you find yourself not understanding the question please send me an email or schedule an appointment. My aim is to evaluate if I did a good job communicating the main points, in addition; I aim to evaluate if you understood the content.\n\nLet’s imagine that you need a model relating crime rate in a “typical” city to the poverty, then you came up with the next model:\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nCrimeRate = 60+5*Poverty\n\\end{equation}\\]\n1.1) What kind of model is this? Provide the right term from the presentation or from page 8 in Westfall & Henning (2013). (10 points)\n1.2) Is this model good to study crime? Answer this question based on the lecture or based on page 9 in Westfall & Henning (2013). (10 points)\n\nIn page 13, Westfall & Henning (2013) define a Purely Probabilistic Statistical Model as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA purely probabilistic statistical model states that a variable \\(Y\\) is produced by a pdf having unknown parameters. In symbolic shorthand, the model is given as \\(Y \\sim p(y|\\theta)\\)\n\n\nBased on this definition, please write the name of three probability models we studied in class. (Hint: Check the lecture Probability distributions and random variables CLICK HERE ) (10 points)\n\nWe studied in class that models generate data, what is the distribution of the following model?, and what information is assumed in the “population model” or data generating process? (10 points)\n\n\n## Average or mean\nMean <- 50\n## Standard deviation\nSD <- 20\nN <- 2000\n\ngeneratedValues <- rnorm(n = N, mean = Mean, sd = SD )\n\nplot(density(generatedValues),\n     xlab = \"generated values\",\n     ylab = \"p(y) or likelihood\",\n     main = \"What is this distribution?\")\n\n\n\n\n\nI explained in class that simulations are good for learning complicated topics in statistics. I also mentioned that simulations help to explain the concept of DATA (uppercase) versus data (lowercase). Explain the concept of DATA and data using the example of tossing a coin (10 points). When we simulate one data set using the Bernoulli distribution, is this data set* DATA* or data? (10 points)\nR contains data sets available for practicing. You can see the list of data sets by running data(). Run the data() function, after that select one data set, then run the function summary(). What information issummary() giving you? (10 points)\n\n\n### Example: I'm running summary() with the data set named 'mtcars'. Select\n### another data set from data()\ndata()\nsummary(mtcars)\n\n\nRead the chapter The most important question: how do I import data? from the lab book. You may read it by clicking HERE.\n\nAfter reading the chapter, please set the working directory in your local computer. Then import the following data set into R: CLICK HERE . Finally estimate the mean life expectancy of year 2019. Your code should look similar to this example:\n\nsetwd(\"write/yourpath/toyour/targetfolder\")\n\nlifexp <- read.csv(\"lifeExpect.csv\")\n\nmean(lifexp$X2019)\n\nInclude your code, and the output after running the code (15 points).\n\nIn this exercise, I will introduce a new function in R. The name of this function is pipe. A pipe is a R function that helps to do several steps in one single line of code. It is like creating a chain of multiple steps.\n\nIn R, pipes are created using this sign: |>. Let’s see the following example:\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n  penguins |>\n    filter(species == \"Adelie\") |>\n    select(bill_depth_mm) |>\n    with(mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n[1] 18.34636\n\n\nIn the code above, I’m performing several steps on the data set named penguins, from the package palmerpenguis. You will see the function filter() from the package dplyr. The function filter() is selecting the penguins classified as “Adelie”, then I’m selecting the column “bill_depth_mm”, and finally I’m estimating the mean of “bill_depth_mm”. As you can see, you can read the pipe as “then do this”. In English you could read: filter penguins by species = “Adelie”, then select the column “bill_depth_mm”, then estimate the mean of “bill_depth_mm”.\nFollowing this explanation, select in the life expectancy data the column “X2019”, after that estimate the mean the the column “X2019”. Include your code, and the output. (15 points)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviuos step\n\n\n\nTo answer this question you have to install the package dplyr, by running this code: install.packages(\"dplyr\"). To use the package you have to run first: library(dplyr). You may read this information first: https://blackhill86.github.io/StatsBook/functionsPack.html"

Because you cannot assign participants randomly to different conditions.\nThat’s why we normally conduct longitudinal studies.\nIn longitudinal studies we can add different cohorts. A cohort is marked by the the date of birth. Let’s imagine you want evaluate the effect of age in social media use. You can add a cohort of participants that were born in 1980, and another cohort that was born in 2001. This two cohorts will help you to understand the impact of social media, or probably the opposite. The impact of age in social use. You might find that older adults look for a different type of content, you may observe differences on how frequent both cohorts use social media."

A cross-sectional study does not follow the individual overtime. In this studies, we collect data only one time at a specific moment. For instance, if you go to a mall tomorrow at 6 p.m. and ask questions to possible participants, you are conducting a crosssectional study. You cannot do a follow-up of the people at the mall. You have information collected at that particular moment.\nIn aging studies, we try to collect information from different age groups to draw conclusions about the effect of age. For instance, you could perform an study where you aim to study muscular flexibility. You would recruit young people, and also not so young participants for your study."

You could have collected the data in 2015, then you come back to measure the same group of students in 2016. But, this time you recruit a new group of teenagers. So, you now have participants that were measure in 2015, and 2016, and you have to continue with the follow up every year.\n\nIn this study, we don’t control the age of the participants. We only aim to recruit new participants every year and do follow ups every year.\nThis is a weak design because there might be cohort effects affecting the study and we don’t control those effects. For instance we might have students that were born in 2000, 1999, 2001 or any other year."

In addition to the assignments described below, you will complete additional individual and group tasks. Specific instructions and due dates to assignments will be announced in class and in the assignment link on Canvas. You might use Microsoft Word, Libre Office, or pdf documents created with Latex or Rmarkdown. Just make sure your document is tidy and meets all the requirements of APA style when applicable.\nResearch Project (25%): With a set of classmates (5 maximum), you will work on a research project throughout the semester. Each of you will be joining other classmates as part of a group in order to complete a research project. Together you will decide on a topic relevant to social psychology, conduct a literature review on that topic, and design and execute your own research study regarding an aspect of that topic that interests you and your group. There are several activities and assignments designed to help you work and complete this research project. Your group and you have limited time to design and execute a research project, for this reason, keep your research topic simple.\nIn order for your group to function at its ultimate capacity, you will be taking on specific leadership roles, which are described below. It is vital that you all carefully consider who you select for these roles, as their ability to perform adequately will have an impact on your group’s performance overall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoles\n\n\n\n\nTeam Leader: The individual that holds this position will be responsible for managing the general group activities. This person will also be submitting the majority of the initial group assignments. This individual needs to be responsible, conscientious, and organized. When necessary, this individual will also schedule Zoom meetings for group members to meet outside of the scheduled class days and times. This person will also serve as the group’s liaison and will contact me via email outside of class for any general group inquiries. This will eliminate a potentially considerable amount of unnecessary emails between myself and other group members if there is a problem with an assignment. This person needs to have Microsoft Word installed on their personal computer or laptop.\n\nThe Team Leader is not the boss of the group or person responsible for completing the group work—ONLY the individual responsible for managing the group.\n\nIRB Coordinator: This individual will be responsible for managing the Institutional Review Board (IRB) Application Packet. As a group, you will ALL work together to complete the packet, but this individual will be responsible for ensuring that any requested revisions to the IRB application packet get done in a timely manner. This person is responsible for contacting me via email with any IRB Application Packet-related group questions. You will receive group points for this application packet and any revisions. The person that holds this position needs to have Microsoft Word installed on their personal computer or laptop.\nQualtrics Coordinator: The individual that holds this position will be responsible for managing the development of your study on Qualtrics. As a group, you will ALL work together to design the initial set-up and revisions. This person is responsible for contacting me via email with any Qualtrics-related group questions. In this class, your group will pilot test your study, the Qualtrics Coordinator will be responsible for completing the logistics of this task. You will still receive group points for the set-up, as long as your Qualtrics Coordinator has made any requested revisions.\nData Manager: The individual that holds this position will be responsible for managing the data for your study. At the end of data collection, this person is responsible for exporting the data from the survey management system, preparing the data for data analysis, and sharing the “final” data set with group members. This person is responsible for contacting me via email with any data management-related group questions. This person needs to have Microsoft Excel installed on their personal computer or laptop.\nPoster Coordinator: The individual that holds this position will be responsible for managing the group conference poster, as well as all of its revisions. As a group, you will all work together to design your poster, but the Poster Coordinator will submit assigned poster drafts and ensure that any requested revisions are made. You will receive group points for the poster and the revisions. This person is responsible for contacting me via email with any poster-related group questions. This person needs to have Microsoft PowerPoint installed on their personal computer or laptop.\n\n\n\nAPA Style Manuscript: You will write your own complete APA Style manuscript about your research project. This manuscript consists of the following elements: Title Page, Introduction, Method, Results (with at least one figure), Discussion, References, and Appendix. There are several activities and assignments designed to help you work and complete this manuscript. Relevant assignments will be graded for content, writing style, and APA Style formatting.\nAPA Style Conference Poster (15%): With your group, you will develop an APA Style conference poster. This poster will be developed using Microsoft PowerPoint and contain the following elements: Title, Authorship, Abstract, Introduction, Method, Results (with at least one figure), Discussion, and References. Other poster elements are encouraged, such as table(s), images, and acknowledgments. You may present your poster at the Undergraduate Symposium organized by the Psychology and Child Development Department.\nGroup Presentation (10%): For your final, with your group, you will give a 10-15 minute presentation of your project. In this presentation, you will provide a summary of the purpose of the study, the previous research, the hypotheses, method, results, discussion of what the results mean, limitations, and future directions for research. This presentation will also include a Q&A session to allow your classmates and me to ask questions and make comments on your research project. You may record your presentation using Zoom and then upload the video to Panopto on Canvas. I will prepare an user guide to show you how to do it.\nSONA. One point will be given for each credit earned via the sona-systems website, http://csustan.sona-systems.com/. Make sure that you sign up using a participant (not a researcher) account, and that you assign the credits to this course. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 11th is the last day to participate in studies, and December 11th is the deadline for assigning credits to this course. I will get a report of the credits assigned to this course on December 11th, which is when they will be added to your grade on Canvas\nLate work: Late assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline. Points will be deducted as follows: one day later will deduct 15% of your grade, two days late represents 25% less in your grade, three days delayed is 0% of your grade.\nDisputing a score: Students are welcome to dispute a score if they believe they were incorrectly deducted for their work. For this, students must provide a written explanation, specifying why they were incorrectly graded.

    "text": "Expectations and Policies\nCommunication skills: You are expected to exercise strong academic verbal and writing skills for expressing yourself to complete class assignments. Failing to clearly communicate your ideas on class assignments may result in you losing points on that assignment. You also need strong analytical and critical thinking skills for completing weekly tasks. I will do my best to respond to emails within 1 - 2 business days (Monday through Friday). If you do not hear back from me within this time interval, send me a follow-up email that includes your original email message. Please keep in mind that if your email question is sent at the last minute it may not be possible to send you a response right before the submission of an assignment or exam. Before emailing me, please see if the answer to your question can be found on the course syllabus, schedule, or Canvas webpage.\nAttendance: If you want a good grade in this class, you need to keep up with the online course material. However, given the format of this course attendance is not contemplated in the final grade.\nDiversity: I will always embrace diversity as the most important human value. It is expected that students understand the importance of creating diverse and safe places free of discrimination by gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. I am an ally to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA) community, and I am available to listen and support you in an affirming manner. I can assist in connecting you with resources on campus to address problems you may face pertaining to sexual orientation and/or gender identity that could interfere with your success at Stan State.\nAcademic misconduct: Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Instances of academic misconduct (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) will result in a grade of zero on the exam/assignment in question. Additionally, you may also receive a lower letter grade or “F” in the class, be reported to Judicial Affairs for academic misconduct activity tracking or disciplinary action, suspended or expelled from the university. It is your responsibility to know the rules. Always paraphrase and cite the source properly according to APA style, avoid copying sentences unless they are necessary, and you cite the author in APA style. Always cite your source! In detail, pay attention to the California Code of Regulations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n“Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Section 41301 notes that students may be”expelled, suspended, placed on probation, or given a lesser sanction for one or more of the following causes which must be campus related: 1. Cheating or plagiarism in connection with an academic program at a campus. . . .” (see “Student Rights & Responsibilities” section of the current Stanislaus State catalog).”\n\n\nAPA Style: Unfortunately, I have to enforce the use of APA style, this is important to generate clean and tidy documentation while you follow scientific formatting. You have to follow the APA style 7th edition, I would recommend to buy the manual or just use this website, it has plenty of information about it, it also provides tools to generate references and citations: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html\nStudents with disabilities: If you are a student with a documented disability at Stan State, please see me immediately to discuss appropriate accommodations. You must email me your letter of accommodation from Stan State’s DRS department as soon as possible. For exam accommodations, you must email me your accommodation letter at least seven days (7) before a scheduled exam to receive your accommodation (see schedule for exam dates). Contact me via email if you wish to discuss your accommodation or if you are in the process of registering for DRS services. Note, that accommodations are not provided retroactively."

    "text": "Let’s make up time for ANOVA\n\nAnalysis of Variance a.k.a ANOVA is a model that helps to analyze mean differences in multiple groups. It is actually very similar to the Classical Regression Model, that’s why I included ANOVA in the Classical Regression Model lecture.\nThe ANOVA model tests the null hypothesis that all group means are equal. It could be represented like this:\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nH_{0}: \\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2} = \\mu_{3}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nThis would be what we call an omnibus test, which means we are testing the overall effect of our independent variable on the dependent variable.\nAs always, let’s understand this with an example:\n\n\n\n\nWage's mean, sd, and variance by Marital Status\n\n\nmaritl\nM\nSD\nvariance\n\n\n\n\n1. Never Married\n92.73\n32.92\n1083.73\n\n\n2. Married\n118.86\n43.12\n1859.38\n\n\n3. Widowed\n99.54\n23.74\n563.64\n\n\n4. Divorced\n103.16\n33.80\n1142.51\n\n\n5. Separated\n101.22\n33.66\n1133.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the table above we can see the mean of wage by marital status, there are males who never married, married, widowed, divorced or separated. ANOVA will help us to answer the question:\n\n\nAre the mean differences in wage by marital status explainable by chance alone?\n\n\nIn this case ANOVA could tell us: Yes! there is a difference, but where?\nIn this scenario, ANOVA will allow us to do pairwise comparisons , this means; we could compare the mean of divorced males versus the mean of married males, but also test all the combinations later on. This is called a post hoc analysis."

In fact, the Classical Regression Model does exactly the same thing.\nRemember: The line of best fit in regression is estimated adding the sum of square distances from the line. The line with the lowest sum of distances is the best line in regression.\nWe are going to do something similar in ANOVA, it is called the Total Sum of Squares (\\(SS_{T}\\)), this calculation will give you the distance from the grand mean:\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nSS_{T} = \\sum^N_{i=1}(x_{i}-\\bar{x}_{(grandMean)})\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\nThe term \\(x_{i}\\) is the score or value for each observation, and \\(\\bar{x}_{(grandMean)}\\) is the overall mean."

While \\(SS_{M}\\) is the total variation accounted by the ANOVA model. \\[\\begin{align}\nMS_{M} &= \\frac{SS_{M}}{df_{M}}\\\\\nMS_{R} &= \\frac{SS_{R}}{df_{R}}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\\(MS_{m}\\) is the average amount of variation explained by the model (e.g., the systematic variation) , whereas \\(MS_{R}\\) is a gauge of the average amount of variation explained by extraneous variables (the unsystematic variation) (Field et al., 2012).\n\nThe \\(df\\) in \\(MS_{M}\\) are estimated by subtracting 1 to the number of groups.

This is the information of the model. We haven’t had time to cover what is likelihood or something call “Maximum Likelihood”.

In this approach you go “forward” by adding one variable at the time, then you compare each model versus the previous model.\nYou may also estimate a big model with multiple predictors.

For instance, if you are interested in romantic relationships. You can say to yourself:\n\nMy first keywords are: “romantic relationships”\nBut, when? When people are teenagers, adults, or aging adults? heterosexual or gay relationships?\nYou may pick teenagers, now you have an additional keyword.\nYou may also pick heterosexual relationships.\nYou can try: romantic relationships, teenagers, adolescence, heterosexual.\n\nIn your first wide search you may find other possible words such as: sexual roles, stereotypes, aggression. or misconceptions in romantic relationships. These words can also be added to your search.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nWhen you are looking for keywords you are in an early exploration stage. You need to read and write down the keywords that are more frequent in your search."

You may find a specific theory that addresses this issue, then you’ll start using the theory’s name as your main keyword or set of keywords.\nFor example, if you study romantic relationship you may come across attachment theory.

You may create the statement:\n\n“The last night it rain because I can see the grass is wet”\n\nBut wait, is there an alternative possible explanation? Yes there is:\n\n“The last night I saw the grass wet, I believe the sprinklers were on last night”\n\nThese are observations about nature, and they can be hypotheses. Let’s make them more hypothesis-like:\n\n“The grass is wet because it rained last night”\n“The grass is wet because the sprinklers were turned on last night”\n-These are statements that you can test and see if they are true or false. How? You may wake up earlier the next morning and check if the sprinklers were working.\n\nBut wait! One observation might not be enough, you don’t know at what time the sprinklers are working if they are really working. Then, you must wake up every morning at different times and record if the sprinklers were working or not. After several mornings, you may find that the sprinklers were a possible cause. Why possible? Because you still don’t know with this method, if the first time you saw the wet grass it rained. And here is where we need to precise different research methods."

See this article as example: Does marriage make people happy, or do happy people get married?\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try to generate a hypothesis:\n\nHappy people has a tendency to get married\n\nOr we could state the following hypothesis:\n\nCouples tend to be happier because they are married\n\nWe could also do the following statement:\n\nThere is a correlation between happiness and being married\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you read carefully you realized that all these statements are measurable, and they can be rejected.

Several of these variables could be dropped from the data set, others will need to be renamed.\n\nDropping variables\nIn this example we will use the function select() from the package tidyverse. Remember that you’ll need to call the package by running library(tidyverse).\n\n🟡 Loading\n  webR...\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWhat is happening here? You may have noticed that inside the function selection() I am adding the name of the variable I want to delete from the data set, and then I added a minus sign. When you add a minus sign before the name of the variable, the package will delete the variable that you list with a minus sign. You can do the same with several variables at the same time:\n\n🟡 Loading\n  webR...\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNow the variables, age, school, and grade are not longer in the dataset, if you don’t believe me click on RUN CODE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 1 (30 points)\n\n\n\n\nDownload the data set ruminationToClean.csv then open the data file using ruminationRaw &lt;- read.csv(file.choose()) or you may copy the code to open the data from the online repository. After opening the data in R, delete from the data set all the variables that start with th stem EATQ_R_.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange variable names\nIn some occasions, the research variable was named wrongly or the name does not reflect the content of the variable. In the data set ruminationToClean.csv there are variables with names in Spanish, we can change them:\n\n🟡 Loading\n  webR...\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn this example, you can see that I’m using the function rename() from the package dplyr which is inside the package tidyverse. When you use rename() you’ll need to declare the new name first and then the old variable name that will be replaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 2 (35 points)\n\n\n\n\nIn psychological measurement it is common to implement questionnaires with Likert-response options. We typically sum the items corresponding to the latent variable or construct that we are measuring. For example in the ruminationToClean.csv the construct of “Rumination” is measured by the Children’s Response Styles Questionnaire (CRSQ), however the variable names are not self-explained. Your task is to change the name of the variables with stem CRSQ, the new variables should have the stem rumination_itemNumber. For example rename(CRSQ1=rumination_1). Remember to save the changes in a new object.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute a new variable\nAs always in programming languages, there are several ways to create a new research variable in a data frame. But, we will use the tidyverse method by using a function that actually works like a verb. The function mutate() will help use to create new variables.\nI mentioned in Exercise 2 psychology studies latent variables also known as hypothetical constructs, they have many names, but at the end we study variables that are implicit; we can measure them but we don’t see them. For example, we have studied variables such depression or rumination in this course, these are latent variables because you cannot capture depression or you don’t see it walking, however you are able to measure depression by asking about symptoms and thoughts.\n\n\n\nExample of a latent variable\n\n\nIn the figure above you can see a representation of a latent variable. In psychology we often assume that the latent variable is the common factor underlying our questions, -in this example- questions related to depression.\nWhen we analyze data that corresponds with latent variables we have two options:\n\nWe can create a Structural Equation Modeling (We won’t cover this topic).\nWe sum all the items to compute a total score. This total score will be our approximation to the latent variable. (Yes, this is covered in this practice).\n\n\n\n\nI’ll show an example in the next chunk of R code:\n\n🟡 Loading\n  webR...\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIn this example we are using the function mutate() to create a new column named depressionTotal, this new depressionTotal column will contain the depression total score for each participant. In this study we included the “Child’s Depression Inventory (CDI)”, that’s why the columns follow the stem “CDI”. You can see the new column in the next table:\n\n\nCode\nruminationRaw &lt;- read.csv(\"ruminationToClean.csv\", na.string = \"99\")\nruminationDepresionScore &lt;- ruminationRaw |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    depressionTotal = rowSums(across(starts_with(\"CDI\")))\n    )\nruminationDepresionScore |&gt; select(starts_with(\"CDI\"),  \n                                   depressionTotal ) |&gt;\n  gt_preview()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      \n      CDI1\n      CDI2\n      CDI3\n      CDI4\n      CDI5\n      CDI6\n      CDI7\n      CDI8\n      CDI9\n      CDI10\n      CDI11\n      CDI12\n      CDI13\n      CDI14\n      CDI15\n      CDI16\n      CDI17\n      CDI18\n      CDI19\n      CDI20\n      CDI21\n      CDI22\n      CDI23\n      CDI24\n      CDI25\n      CDI26\n      depressionTotal\n    \n  \n  \n    1\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n15\n    2\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\n0\n1\n0\n2\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n2\n1\n0\n0\n15\n    3\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n    4\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n6\n    5\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n2\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n17\n    6..211\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    212\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n5\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 3 (30 points)\n\n\n\n\nIn the data set ruminationToClean.csv you’ll find seven columns with the stem “DASS”. These columns correspond to the instrument named: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). This is an scale that measures three latent variables at the same time, but only the anxiety items were added in this study.\n\nYour task is to change the name of the “DASS” items, you should think a more informative name for these items in the data frame. After that, you will have to compute the total score of anxiety for each participant in the data frame.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s cleanse this data set\n\n\n\nIt is always satisfactory to clean a data set and then see the final product, but so far we have cleaned these data in small steps. I’ll clean the data set in one step. In this example I will delete unnecessary columns (aka research variables), and I will translate the variables to English when necessary:\n\n🟡 Loading\n  webR...\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 4 (10 points)\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the steps taken in the R code above."
