It includes cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using questionnaires or structured interviews for data collection—with the intent of generalizing from a sample to a population.\nExperimental research: seeks to determine if a specific treatment influences an outcome. The researcher assesses this by providing a specific treatment to one group and withholding it from another and then determining how both groups scored on an outcome.\n\nTrue experiments\nQuasi-experiments\n\nSingle-subject designs"

Also, none of them is sufficient to start the fire. After all, a match must stay “hot” long enough to start combustion; it must contact\ncombustible material such as dry leaves. We also need oxygen!"

(2002) :\n\nIt is insufficient because a match cannot start a fire without the other conditions.\nIt is nonredundant only if it adds something fire-promoting that is uniquely different from what the other factors in the constellation (e.g., oxygen, dry leaves) contribute to starting a fire. It is part of a sufficient condition to start a fire in combination with the full constellation of factors. But that condition is not necessary because there are other sets of conditions that can also start fires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nMany factors are usually required for an effect to occur, but we rarely know all of them and how they relate to each other. This is one reason that the causal relationships we discuss are not deterministic but only increase the probability that an effect will occur."
