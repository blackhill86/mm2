  abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters are added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximumlikelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus. The real-data analyses use data from Holzinger and Swineford’s (1939) classic mental abilities study, Big Five personality factor data from a British survey, and science achievement data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.},

  abstract = {This study aimed at demonstrating the usefulness and ﬂexibility of the Bayesian structural equation modeling approximate measurement invariance (BSEM-AMI) approach to within-couple data. The substantive aim of the study was investigating partner differences in the perception of relationship quality (RQ) in a sample of intact couples (n = 435) drawn from the ﬁrst sweep of the Millenium Cohort Study. Conﬁgural, weak and strong invariance models were tested using both maximum likelihood (ML) and BSEM approaches. As evidence of a lack of strong invariance was found, full and partial AMI models were speciﬁed, allowing nine different prior variances or “wiggle rooms.” Although we could ﬁnd an adequately ﬁtting BSEM-AMI model allowing for approximate invariance of all the intercepts, the two-step approach proposed by Muthén and Asparouhov (2013b) for identifying problematic parameters and applying AMI only to them provided less biased results. Findings similar to the ML partial invariance model, led us to conclude that women reported a higher RQ than men. The results of this study highlight the need to inspect parameterization indeterminacy (or alignment) and support the efﬁcacy of the two-step approach to BSEM-AMI.},

  abstract = {Bridging the gap between traditional classical statistics and a Bayesian approach, David Kaplan provides readers with the concepts and practical skills they need to apply Bayesian methodologies to their data analysis problems. Part I addresses the elements of Bayesian inference, including exchangeability, likelihood, prior/posterior distributions, and the Bayesian central limit theorem. Part II covers Bayesian hypothesis testing, model building, and linear regression analysis, carefully explaining the differences between the Bayesian and frequentist approaches. Part III extends Bayesian statistics to multilevel modeling and modeling for continuous and categorical latent variables. Kaplan closes with a discussion of philosophical issues and argues for an "evidence-based" framework for the practice of Bayesian statistics. Ideal for use in teaching or self-study, the book fully illustrates all concepts with data examples from large-scale educational and social science databases, utilizing open-source R software programs.

  isbn = {978-1-4419-1575-7},
  abstract = {Computational techniques based on simulation have now become an essential part of the statistician's toolbox. It is thus crucial to provide statisticians with a practical understanding of those methods, and there is no better way to develop intuition and skills for simulation than to use simulation to solve statistical problems. Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R covers the main tools used in statistical simulation from a programmer's point of view, explaining the R implementation of each simulation technique and providing the output for better understanding and comparison. While this book constitutes a comprehensive treatment of simulation methods, the theoretical justification of those methods has been considerably reduced, compared with Robert and Casella (2004). Similarly, the more exploratory and less stable solutions are not covered here. This book does not require a preliminary exposure to the R programming language or to Monte Carlo methods, nor an advanced mathematical background. While many examples are set within a Bayesian framework, advanced expertise in Bayesian statistics is not required. The book covers basic random generation algorithms, Monte Carlo techniques for integration and optimization, convergence diagnoses, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, including Metropolis \{Hastings and Gibbs algorithms, and adaptive algorithms. All chapters include exercises and all R programs are available as an R package called mcsm. The book appeals to anyone with a practical interest in simulation methods but no previous exposure. It is meant to be useful for students and practitioners in areas such as statistics, signal processing, communications engineering, control theory, econometrics, finance and more. The programming parts are introduced progressively to be accessible to any reader. Christian P. Robert is Professor of Statistics at Universit\'e Paris Dauphine, and Head of the Statistics Laboratory of CREST, both in Paris, France.

  abstract = {In a frequentist framework, the exact fit of a structural equation model (SEM) is typically evaluated with the chi-square test and at least one index of approximate fit. Current Bayesian SEM (BSEM) software provides one measure of overall fit: the posterior predictive p value (PPP␹2). Because of the noted limitations of PPP␹2, common practice for evaluating Bayesian model fit instead focuses on model comparison, using information criteria or Bayes factors. Fit indices developed under maximumlikelihood estimation have not been incorporated into software for BSEM. We propose adapting 7 chi-square-based approximate fit indices for BSEM, using a Bayesian analog of the chi-square model-fit statistic. Simulation results show that the sampling distributions of the posterior means of these fit indices are similar to their frequentist counterparts across sample sizes, model types, and levels of misspecification when BSEMs are estimated with noninformative priors. The proposed fit indices therefore allow overall model-fit evaluation using familiar metrics of the original indices, with an accompanying interval to quantify their uncertainty. Illustrative examples with real data raise some important issues about the proposed fit indices' application to models specified with informative priors, when Bayesian and frequentist estimation methods might not yield similar results.},

For increasing sample sizes, however, the applicability of current fit statistics evaluating model fit within Bayesian CFA is limited. We propose, therefore, a Bayesian variant of the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the BRMSEA. A simulation study was performed with variations in model misspecification, factor loading magnitude, number of indicators, number of factors, and sample size. This showed that the 90\% posterior probability interval of the BRMSEA is valid for evaluating model fit in large samples (N ! 1,000), using cutoff values for the lower ($\backslash$.05) and upper limit ($\backslash$.08) as guideline. An empirical illustration further shows the advantage of the BRMSEA in large sample Bayesian CFA models. In conclusion, it can be stated that the BRMSEA is well suited to evaluate model fit in large sample Bayesian CFA models by taking sample size and model complexity into account.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with measures of fit of a model. Two types of error involved in fitting a model are considered. The first is error of approximation which involves the fit of the model, with optimally chosen but unknown parameter values, to the population covariance matrix. The second is overall error which involves the fit of the model, with parameter values estimated from the sample, to the population covariance matrix. Measures of the two types of error are proposed and point and interval estimates of the measures are suggested. These measures take the number of parameters in the model into account in order to avoid penalizing parsimonious models. Practical difficulties associated with the usual tests of exact fit or a model are discussed and a test of ``close fit'' of a model is suggested.},

A modification of the standard null hypothesis of zero difference in fit is proposed allowing for testing an interval hypothesis that the difference in fit between models is small, rather than zero.

  abstract = {Summary. We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the `hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

  abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2$\lambda$/n, where $\lambda$ is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

The main goal of tests for measurement invariance is to establish whether support exists for the null hypothesis of invariance. Bayesian hypothesis testing enables researchers to investigate this null hypothesis, where evidence in favor of invariance is quantified using the Bayes factor. A Bayes factor for the investigation of measurement invariance assumptions of test items for randomly selected groups was developed by Verhagen and Fox (2013a). For specific groups or measurement occasions, a different Bayes factor test is proposed here, which directly evaluates item parameter differences between groups. This test is compared to recently developed frequentist measurement invariance tests based on the Wald test in a simulation study. The close-comparison with the Wald-test performance validates the proposed Bayes factor and shows the advantages of the additional information given by the Bayes factor. Both tests are applied to the investigation of measurement invariance of a geometry test (CBASE) to illustrate the use of the Bayes factor test for measurement invariance.},

  abstract = {Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of ``significance'' should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their ``behavior'' in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.},

Next, they return to specific models analyzed using SEM, focusing on those that expand the array of latent variable types encountered in SEM. Building on the presentation of latent variable types and definitions of latent variables, they highlight a number of properties of latent variables that influence how they are specified and interpreted.
