## Welcome!

If you are in this page is because you are student in my PSYC 3000 class. Sometimes Canvas doesn't like my presentation in html format. So, I decided to create my own site where you can access my presentations.

You might not be an student in my class, but you knew about me and this class from other sources. That's totally fine! You are also welcomed!
